CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.
Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They surveyed in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.
My task as a data analyst is to convert these survey results into meaningful insights that the team can use to drive actions.
